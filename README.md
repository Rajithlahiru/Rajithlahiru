# Hi there! I'm Rajith Lahiru 👋

## About Me

I'm an enthusiastic **Associate Data Engineer at iLabs** and a **former Intern Data Engineer at Wiley**. I have a strong passion for designing and optimizing **data lakehouse architectures** using open-source technologies. My expertise spans **real-time data processing**, **metadata-driven ETL workflows**, and **cloud infrastructure**.
